# Work in progress

Currently trying to find the time to finish this

## Purpose
Anet charges money (in USD, so will incur conversion fees too) to add a single tab of either Equipment or Build Template for a toon.

The equipment and builds can be exported and imported with a code.

In that case, the purpose of this tool is to store these codes locally to allow copy-pasting whenever I need to change my equipment/build.

Bit of a hassle, but at least it's free `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`


## Working features
- basic UI
- add builds/equip by profession
- each profession can add diff builds for pvp, pve, wvw
- store builds locally as json
- load builds from json
